## Split Message

Split message lets you decide whether to show up to the 2000 Discord character limit for code messages, or whether to split them into separate messages.

How to enable/disable the 'split message' function:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access & Use Dashboard" icon="fingerprint" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h3">
    Follow the steps in [Accessing the Dashboard](/dashboard/access) to login to the dashboard, then visit [Using the Dashboard](/dashboard/use) to select a server and start configuring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate & Enable / Disable" icon="binoculars" iconType="solid" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h3">
    On the server page, find the 'Code Detection Config' box. It should be at the bottom, regardless of mobile or PC. Find the 'Split Overlength Messages' box. Click the enable or disable button as needed. The current setup will be auto selected on page load.
