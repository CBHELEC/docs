  <Step title="Locate Skullboard Settings" icon="binoculars" iconType="solid" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    On the server page, find the skullboard configuration box. It should be the very first one shown, regardless of mobile or PC. Find the 'Split Overlength Messages' box. The current settings will be auto selected on page load.

  <Step title="Configure Skullboard" icon="wrench" iconType="solid" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h2">
    There is only one option to configure, in the form of a dropdown. This shows all of the channels in your server, in order, with any uncategorised at the top. To fully <u>disable</u> skullboard, open the dropdown and select the '🚫 Disable' option. To setup skullboard in a channel, open the dropdown, and pick any channel shown. Now, when a message gets three '💀' reactions, it automatically gets forwarded there.
