The Dashboard is the intuitive, simple to use webpage which you can use to configure Tracker in your own server. Instead of using clunky, long commands which are quite frankly just bad, just open the Dashboard, select a server and start configuring\!

To access the Dashboard, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dashboard page" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    On any web browser, navigate to https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz. Be patient, it may take a second or two to load.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to the Dashboard" icon="id-card" iconType="regular" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    <Tip>
      We recommend doing this on a Computer (PC or Laptop). The mobile UI is frankly cursed and we will fix it in due time.
    </Tip>
    Once you have opened the Dashboard, press the 'Login' button in the middle of the page. This will redirect you to the Discord Authorisation page, where you can review the permissions and then press 'Authorise'.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once these steps have been followed, you should see a grid of the servers that you are in. You are now ready to select the server you want and start configuring\!
