The Dashboard is the intuitive, simple to use webpage which you can use to configure Tracker in your own server. Instead of using clunky, long commands which are quite frankly just bad, just open the Dashboard, select a server and start configuring!

To access the Dashboard, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dashboard page" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    On any web browser, navigate to https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz. Be patient, it may take a second or two to load.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to the Dashboard" icon="id-card" iconType="regular" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    Once you have opened the Dashboard and agreed to the ToS and Privacy Policy, press the 'Login' button. This will redirect you to the Discord Authorisation page, where you can review the permissions and then press 'Authorise'.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once these steps have been followed, you should see a grid of the servers that you are in. You are now ready to select the server you want and start configuring!
