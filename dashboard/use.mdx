If you are following this in order, which is unlikely, you previously will have opened, and logged into the Dashboard. You are now ready to start configuring your server's settings, so let's do that now.

To configure your server, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Server" icon="hand-pointer" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    You need to actually pick a server to configure, so look through the grid of servers until you find the one you want to configure. Then simply click (or press) on that server to open it. If Tracker is not in that server, it will appear greyed out with a <Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" /> symbol next to it instead of a <Icon icon="chevron-right" iconType="solid" /> symbol, and clicking on it opens a Tracker invite to that server. However, if it is in the server, it would have a <Icon icon="chevron-right" iconType="solid" /> symbol and open to that server's specific configuration page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Configuring" icon="sliders" iconType="solid" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    That's it! You've selected the server you want to configure, now its time to go wild with the not many options to change them to whatever suits you best.
  </Step>
