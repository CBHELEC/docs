Code Recognition is arguably the main focus of Tracker. Whenever you send a message containing any valid (maximum 7 characters including the GC/TB, are complete and not split) TB or GC code, Tracker detects it and retrieves info for it. This info is then sent in a nicely displayed message straight to your channel so that your friends, members and you know what that cache or trackable is, and some brief info on it.

The info shown includes cache type, size, owner, name, difficulty, terrain, and FP count. The name shown also doubles as a link to the cache page.

Code recognition is arguably the most important part of Tracker.
