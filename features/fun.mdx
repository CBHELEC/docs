The fun command set is one of two command sets that you can enable and disable via the Dashboard. See more on how to do that @ [How To Use The Dashboard](/dashboard/use).

There are 15 fun commands. Each does a different thing, but what is that thing?

- /fun math \<equation\> -\> Solves that equation. 

  Doesn't do algebra, solve for 𝑥, or anything complicated, but it can solve 2+2 if you can't.
- /fun furry \<Image / GIF\> -\> Sends you a picture, or GIF, of a furry.

  Why? Don't know. I was feeling silly. Does it work? Yes. Is it one of my favourite commands? Yes.
- /fun locationprofile _optional:\<user\> _-\> Creates or shows your's, or someone elses locationprofile.

  What is a locationprofile? It is a newer feature, where you can add your timezone and country for other users to view. They can also configure theirs, just tell em to run the command.
- /fun userinfo _optional:\<user\>_ -\> Shows information about a user, or you.

  Typical userinfo command. You leave user blank, it's you. You fill in user, it's them. Shows user ID, name, PFP, account creation and server join dates, whether they have the Administrator permission or are a Server Booster, and their top 10 roles.
- /fun fakedoxx _optional:\<user\>_ -\> Shows fake IP and Country for a user, or you.

  Another silly command. Makes up a random IP and selects a random country for the user (if selected), or you. It has disclaimers though, so don't get too excited.
- /fun petpet _optional:\<user\>_ -\> Shows a petpet animation for a user, or you.

  Yet another silly command. The user's (or your) PFP gets pet. That's it. Try it and see.
- /fun image \<query\> -\> Searches Google for images related to the query.

  Part of two google-related commands, this one finds images. That's it.
- /fun google \<query\> -\> Searches Google for results related to the query.

  The second (or first, depending on how you look at it) google-related command, to find links / results related to the query. Simple.
- /fun avatar _optional:\<user\>_ -\> Shows a user's (or your) avatar.

  Read the text above. What else is there to say?
- /fun coinflip -\> Flips a coin.

  Heads or Tails? No clue, try it and see. Exactly 50% chance of each. You get cool coin designs (they're not that great) and a way to annoy your friends... if you have any.
- /fun 8ball \<question\> _optional:\<potato_mode\>_ -\> Asks the magic 8ball a question.

  You enter the question, and choose whether to leave potato mode blank or not. Blank, normal 8ball answers. You enable potato mode, and get deranged, stupid answers. Can you collect them all?
- /fun owo_encode \<text\> -\> Turns your normal text into OwOs.

  Deranged, deprived, depression. Turn into something else and make all your text OwO-ified.
- /fun owo_decode \<text\> -\> Turns your OwO-ified text into normal words.

  The counterpart to owo_encode, it does what it says.\
  This one actually has a second way to trigger. Right click or press and hold a message, go to apps, and it appears there. No need to paste the ~~depression~~ text that way.
- /fun cat -\> Sends an image of a Cat. 

  Does what it says. It sends an image of a Cat.\
  20% chance for something special.
- /fun dog -\> Sends an image of a Dog.

  Does what it says. It sends an image of a Dog.
- /fun define \<word\> -\> Defines a word.

  Does what it says. Walking, but not talking, that would be weird, dictionary.
- /fun roll \<maxroll\> -\> Rolls a random number up until maxroll.

  Does what it says. If maxroll is 100, it gets a random number between and including 1 and 100.
