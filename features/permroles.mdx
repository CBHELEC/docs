description: "What are permission roles? Why do they exist?"

Permission roles are what let users use the /message and the /foxfil command(s). The message commands (say, reply, react, edit, delete) let users interact as the bot. Why? No idea. It's cool. See [here](/features/interact) for more info on that. The foxfil command sends a stupidly long message with a ton of useful Geocaching sites and apps. It's restricted behind permission roles because it is, well, stupidly long. On PC, it's roughly 63 lines. On mobile, it's more like 100 lines.

## Why do permission roles exist?

We added permission roles so that the Admins of a server can control who can use the commands to prevent abuse and spam. Since they can be used to create textwalls and potentially violate rules, it felt right to let bot users limit them to only those who need them or are trusted with them.
