The skullboard module allows your server to highlight and remember those funny, out of context messages and moments which are the best.

Skullboard is essentially a reskinned starboard, if you know what that is. If you don't, it's basically meant to forward the memorable, or pretty much any message to a channel to , to a channel. Skullboard is just for when its stupid and out of context and you want to frame it.

Skullboard is activated when any message in a channel Tracker has access to gets 3 reactions with a 'ðŸ’€' emoji. It then, if configured, sends it to the skullboard channel.

In summary, here's how skullboard is triggered:
