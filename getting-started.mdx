## Installing Tracker in your server

Put simply, it needs to be in your server to work. This is how you can do that, as quickly as possible.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite Link" icon="link" iconType="regular" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    Open https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz in any browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discord Login" icon="id-card" iconType="regular" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    If not already logged in, it will make you login to your Discord account, before bringing up a menu. Press 'Authorise', which will return you to the Tracker Dashboard and log you in.

    <Note>
      To add Tracker to a server, you need to be Server Owner, Administrator or have the Manage Server permission.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding to Server" icon="user-plus" iconType="regular" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h2">
    Once the Dashboard has loaded, a list of the servers you are in will appear. A server only shows up when you are Server Owner, Administrator or have the Manage Server permission\! Locate the server you want to add Tracker to, and click on it. The server will appear greyed out before you add Tracker to it. This will then bring up a menu where you can click 'Add to Server', then 'Continue', then 'Authorise'. This will now add Tracker to your server\!

    <Tip>
      If the Dashboard method doesn't work, try adding Tracker via the [App Directory](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1322305662973116486) or it's [Direct Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1322305662973116486). See more info [here](https://docs.trackerbot.xyz/other-invite).

## What do the permissions mean?

1. View Channels
   - Allows the bot to view channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in.
2. Send Messages (in threads)
   - Allows the bot to send messages in channels and / or threads which it has allow or neutral permissions in.
3. Embed Links
   - Allows the bot to send links which have embed previews below them.
4. Attach Files
   - Allows the bot to send images, audio or any files.
5. Read Message History
   - Allows the bot to read previous messages in channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in.
6. Use External Emojis
   - Allows the bot to use emojis from other servers in its messages and embeds. This is neccesary.
