# Getting Started

## Installing Tracker in your server <a href="#installation" id="installation"></a>

Put simply, it needs to be in your server to work. This is how you can do that, as quickly as possible.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Invite Link
    
    Open [https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=1322305662973116486](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1322305662973116486) in any browser.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Discord Login
    
    If not already logged in, it will make you login to your Discord account, before bringing up a menu. Press 'Add to Server', and use the dropdown to select which server to add Tracker to, before clicking 'Continue'
    
    {% hint style="info" %}
    To add Tracker to a server, you need to be Server Owner, Administrator or have the Manage Server permission.
    {% endhint %}
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Permissions and Authorise
    
    Once the server has been selected, a list of permissions will show up. Review these permissions (more info on them <a href="getting-started.md#what-do-the-permissions-mean" class="button secondary">here</a>) and then click 'Authorise' to add Tracker to the server.
    
    {% hint style="danger" %}
    To avoid any issues, please keep all listed permissions. Tracker can work with more permissions too, however they will not be used.
    {% endhint %}
  </Step>
</Steps>
